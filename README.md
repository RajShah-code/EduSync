## Problem Statement

In traditional computer labs:
- Students struggle to clearly see the instructor’s screen  
- Attendance is manual and prone to proxy  
- Practical exams are hard to monitor fairly  
- Student progress tracking is inconsistent  
- Network issues risk loss of student work  

EduSync solves these problems with a **smart, centralized digital lab environment**.
